Gaussian Elimination Solver

A Java program to solve systems of linear equations using Gaussian elimination.
The program performs the complete process of converting a matrix to row-echelon form, normalizing the diagonal, and performing back-substitution to find the solution. It also calculates the accuracy of the solution by comparing the computed results with the original system.
